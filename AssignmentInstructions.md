Deliverables 
IS 401 – Project Management and Systems Design 
You will complete this project in four one-day sprints (ending at midnight on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday), with your final deliverable and presentation due on Friday. Each day has specific deliverables for this class. You will get half of the points simply for completing each step, and the other half of points will be awarded based on the quality of your submission. 
Make a copy of this Figjam board and submit the link through IS 401’s Learning Suite on Monday. Fill it out throughout the week. Each day’s section is due by 11:59pm that night. 
Monday — Requirements (6.5 pts) 
Focus on understanding the problem and planning your work.

Then reflect as a team on how well your solution solves the customer problem you set out to improve. 
IS 413 – Enterprise Application Development 
 
The time has come to apply all the skills that we have learned in class.  While you have not done everything that is required in this project, you have the foundation to be able to dig in and figure it out using .NET and React.  The web app you build will be the face of this project, so use it to impress the judges.  Here are the requirements: 
 
Build all the required pages with all the required functionality (including, but not limited to): 
 
Public (Non-Authenticated Users) 
Home / Landing Page:  A modern, professional landing page that introduces the organization, its mission, and provides clear calls to action for visitors to engage or support. 
Impact / Donor-Facing Dashboard:  Displays aggregated, anonymized data showing the organization’s impact (e.g., outcomes, progress, and resource use) in a clear and visually understandable way. 
Login Page:  Allows users to authenticate using a username and password, with proper validation and error handling. 
Privacy Policy + Cookie Consent:  Provides a privacy policy explaining data usage and includes a GDPR-compliant cookie consent notification (see the IS414 section for more information). 
Admin / Staff Portal (Authenticated Users Only) 
Admin Dashboard: Provides a high-level overview of key metrics such as active residents across safehouses, recent donations, upcoming case conferences, and summarized progress data. Think of this as the “command center” for staff managing daily operations.
Donors & Contributions: Allows staff to view, create, and manage supporter profiles, including classification by type (monetary donor, volunteer, skills contributor, etc.) and status (active/inactive). Tracks all types of contributions (monetary, in-kind, time, skills, social media) and allows staff to record and review donation activity. Supports viewing donation allocations across safehouses and program areas.
Caseload Inventory: This is the core case management page. It maintains records for all residents following the structure used by Philippine social welfare agencies. Staff can view, create, and update resident profiles including demographics, case category and sub-categories (e.g., trafficked, victim of physical abuse, neglected), disability information, family socio-demographic profile (4Ps beneficiary, solo parent, indigenous group, informal settler), admission details, referral information, assigned social workers, and reintegration tracking. This page should support filtering and searching by case status, safehouse, case category, and other key fields.
Process Recording: Provides forms for entering and viewing dated counseling session notes for each resident. Each process recording entry captures the session date, social worker, session type (individual or group), emotional state observed, a narrative summary of the session, interventions applied, and follow-up actions. Staff should be able to view the full history of process recordings for any resident, displayed chronologically. This is the primary tool for documenting the healing journey of each resident.
Home Visitation & Case Conferences: Allows staff to log home and field visits, including the visit type (initial assessment, routine follow-up, reintegration assessment, post-placement monitoring, or emergency), observations about the home environment, family cooperation level, safety concerns, and follow-up actions. Also provides a view of case conference history and upcoming conferences for each resident.
Reports & Analytics: Displays aggregated insights and trends to support decision-making. This should include donation trends over time, resident outcome metrics (education progress, health improvements), safehouse performance comparisons, and reintegration success rates. Consider structuring reports to align with the Annual Accomplishment Report format used by Philippine social welfare agencies, which tracks services provided (caring, healing, teaching), beneficiary counts, and program outcomes.

Misc 
Any additional pages required to support functionality described in other portions of the project (e.g., security, social media, accessibility, or partner features). 
 
Use .NET 10 / C# on the back end and React / TypeScript (Vite) on the front end. You can choose from Azure SQL Database, MySQL, or PostgreSQL for the relational database. The security database may be housed separately if you choose. Use good database principles in your design. Your app and your database must both be deployed. I would recommend using Microsoft Azure since you have the practice and the credits, but it is totally up to your team if you want to make it harder on yourself and deploy somewhere else. ;) You may modify the database as needed. 
  
Make sure to validate data and handle errors so the website is robust and reliable. Put into practice all the things we learned about writing good code. Pay attention to the details and finishing touches—titles, icons, logos, consistent look and feel, pagination, speed, and other elements that separate good websites from excellent ones.   
IS 414 - Security 
The IS414 portion of INTEX includes BOTH applying skills you have already learned AND learning how to implement a few new skills now that you have sufficient technical background to complete them. 
 
In industry, features that are not documented (especially security features) don’t “exist”. If you would like to receive INTEX points for the security requirements, they MUST be clearly shown in your group’s submitted video. Please don’t spend hours implementing features and then spend seconds or minutes documenting a fraction of your work unless you would prefer to receive a fraction of the points. Appeals to grant points that are not documented at the due date will be denied. 
 
Requirements 
Confidentiality (Encryption) 
Use HTTPS for all public connections. It is fine if you use a subdomain and you may rely upon certificates automatically provided by the cloud provider, but you must have a valid certificate to enable TLS. 
Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. 
Authentication 
Provide the functionality to authenticate users using a username/password (likely using ASP.NET Identity). Your identity database can be in SQLite or found in a database server. 
Visitors (unauthenticated users) should be able to browse the home page of the site (and possibly other pages that do not need authentication) 
Authenticated users should be able to view the page(s) described in the IS413 section. 
Configure ASP.NET Identity (or your chosen Identity provider) to require better passwords than the default PasswordOptions (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity-configuration?view=aspnetcore-10.0 for information on the settings to change, but DO NOT follow the values suggested there). This will be STRICTLY graded according to how you were taught in class and how you were instructed to implement password policies in your lab. AI or other code/documentation suggesting policies that conflict with how you were taught in class will NOT be considered a reason to grant points. 
All APIs should have the appropriate authentication/authorization. For example, a /login and /auth/me endpoint cannot require authentication/authorization or else they are useless, but endpoints supporting most CRUD operations (certainly all the “CUD” operations and likely some “R” operations) of the database must only be accessible/usable to authenticated and appropriately authorized users. When in doubt, make it maximally restrictive unless it breaks functionality. 
Role-Based (RBAC) Authorization 
Only an authenticated user with an admin role should be able to add, modify, or in rare cases delete data. Only authenticated users who are donors should be able to see their donor history and the impact of those donations. Non-authenticated users without a role should be able to see some of the site (e.g., homepage, privacy policy, etc.). You may choose whether or not to have a staff (or employee) role that differs from the admin user. 
Integrity 
Data should only be able to be changed or deleted by an authorized, authenticated user and there must be confirmation required to delete data. For example, an administrator could update or delete data because they are authorized to do so. 
Credentials 
Handle credentials (usernames and passwords, API keys, etc.) safely. You may choose to use a secrets manager, place secrets in a separate file (e.g., an .env file) that is not uploaded to a code repository like GitHub or set environmental variables in your operating system. All three of these are viable options and will be granted full points. Some of these options are easier in deployment than others. You should not include credentials in your code or public repositories. Please note that having a functional site is worth more overall points than protecting credentials properly, so prioritize wisely (as much as this pains your instructor). Make it obvious how you are implementing this in your video. 
Privacy 
Create and populate the content of a GDPR-compliant privacy policy that is linked from the footer of your site (at a minimum on the home page). You may use existing templates (see https://gdpr.eu/privacy-notice/) or generators, but the content should be tailored to your site. This will not be evaluated by a lawyer, and you should not pay for this. Current LLMs are quite adept at creating and modifying “boilerplate” privacy policies. 
Enable a GDPR-compliant cookie consent notification. Be specific in your video about whether this is cosmetic or fully functional. 
Attack Mitigations 
Enable the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) HTTP HEADER. Specify the sources you need for your site to function and no more (e.g., you might choose to define default-src, style-src, img-src, script-src, etc., but only choose what you need). It is possible to embed CSP information in a <meta> tag in the HTML, but that is not what is being evaluated here. Graders will be evaluating whether the CSP header is present in the developer tools inspector. 
Availability 
Your site should be publicly accessible. This likely means that it is deployed to a cloud provider of your selection. 
Additional Security Features 
Some points will be allocated to adding additional security/privacy features beyond what is explicitly listed here. This allows for creativity in approach. Whatever you add, you must make clear to the TAs in your video documentation. Please briefly describe what you added and why it was added. The following list is not exhaustive but may give an idea of what types of features to consider. Some could be worth full points; most will be worth partial points depending on complexity and time required to implement and so you may choose to implement multiple additional security features. 
Enable at least one type of third-party authentication. The third-party provider(s) are up to you. 
Enable at least one form of two-factor or multi-factor authentication. You have flexibility in the choice and implementation. Note: You must have at least one admin and one non-admin user account without 2FA or MFA for grading purposes so we can access your site without having your phones/faces/etc. 
Enable HTTP Secure Transport Security (HSTS) on your site. This can be tricky or trivial depending on your chosen cloud architecture. A single line of code is sufficient in some cases, but NOT in others. Don’t underestimate the time required here in case your deployment is “tricky”. 
Enable a browser accessible cookie (i.e., NOT an httponly cookie) that saves a user setting that is used by React to change the page. Examples might include light/dark mode preferences, color theme preferences, language preferences, etc.  
Enable data sanitization (for incoming data) or data encoding (for data rendered by the frontend) to help prevent injection attacks 
Deploy both operational and identity databases to “real” DBMS (i.e., not SQLite). 
Deploy using Docker containers instead of simply deploying to a VM 
Or many, many other potential options

IS 455 – Machine Learning 
 
 The organization you are building technology for collects rich data across multiple dimensions: donor activity, resident case histories, counseling sessions, education progress, health outcomes, home visitation reports, safehouse operations, and social media engagement. The organization’s leadership wants to understand how machine learning can help them make better decisions and improve outcomes for the girls they serve.
This is your opportunity to practice pipeline thinking, the central idea of this course. Machine learning is not a collection of algorithms learned in isolation. It is an end-to-end decision system that begins with problem framing and ends with deployed, monitored systems. Your task is to demonstrate that you can build that complete system thoughtfully, creatively, and rigorously.
Requirements
You should deliver as many complete machine learning pipelines as you can identify and have time to build, integrated into or supported by the web application your team is building. Each pipeline must follow the full end-to-end ML pipeline as taught in the textbook and should address a meaningful business question for the organization. There is no maximum. The more pipelines your team delivers (with quality), the better your score. However, don’t spend more time on this requirement than it’s worth (1/5 of your overall INTEX grade).
Each pipeline should demonstrate the full lifecycle as outlined in the Foreword:
1.        Problem Framing (Ch. 1): Define the business question, select success metrics, and determine whether a predictive or explanatory approach is appropriate. This is one of the most important decisions you will make. As the textbook explains, prediction and explanation are two distinct modeling goals that are related but not interchangeable. Predictive modeling aims to generate reliable predictions judged by performance on new, unseen data. Explanatory modeling aims to understand and quantify relationships between variables, ideally identifying cause-and-effect patterns that can inform strategy or policy. Confusing these two goals is a common source of costly analytical mistakes. For each pipeline, generate both a causal and predictive model. Besides deploying a predictive pipeline, indicate within the .ipynb file which features are most impactful and recommend decisions that can be made based on the results
2.        Data Acquisition and Preparation (Ch. 2–5, 7): Identify and collect the data needed from the provided tables. Clean, transform, and engineer features from raw data. As the textbook notes, data preparation is often the most time-intensive stage of any analytics project. Expect to spend 60–80% of your pipeline effort here. Build reproducible data preparation pipelines (Ch. 7), not one-off scripts.
3.        Exploration (Ch. 6, 8): Examine distributions, relationships, and anomalies to build intuition about the data before modeling. This is where you discover what the data can actually tell you. Look for the relationships that have been built into this dataset. They are there to be found.
4.        Modeling (Ch. 9–14): Select and train algorithms that learn patterns from the data. You may use any approach covered in the course: multiple linear regression for causal or predictive purposes (Ch. 9–11), decision trees (Ch. 12), classification (Ch. 13), or ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, and stacking (Ch. 14). Remember that for explanatory work, a model that sacrifices some predictive accuracy to produce clear, defensible estimates, like a carefully specified OLS regression, can be preferable to a black-box model with marginally better predictions. For predictive work, complex features and less interpretable models can be appropriate when they improve accuracy and operational performance.
5.        Evaluation and Selection (Ch. 15): Assess model performance using appropriate metrics, validation strategies, and fairness checks. Use proper train/test splits or cross-validation. Tune hyperparameters. Compare multiple models where appropriate. Most importantly, interpret your results in business terms. Don’t just report an R² or accuracy score. Explain what the numbers mean for the organization’s decisions.
6.        Feature Selection (Ch. 16): Thoughtfully select which features to include. Demonstrate that you understand why certain features matter and others don’t. Use feature importance, selection techniques, or domain reasoning to justify your choices.
7.        Deployment (Ch. 17): Move your validated model into the production web application where it can generate predictions, automate decisions, or inform stakeholders. This could mean serving predictions through an API endpoint, displaying model outputs on a dashboard, or providing an interactive interface where users can input data and receive predictions or insights.
Each pipeline should address a different business problem. Teams should try to demonstrate a variety of modeling approaches across their pipelines; ideally including at least one predictive model and one explanatory model, but this is not strictly required. The dataset has been designed with multiple discoverable relationships across the donor domain, the case management domain, and the social media/outreach domain. Look carefully at the data and think about what questions the organization would want answered.
Why These Instructions Are Intentionally Vague
In the real world, nobody hands you a target variable and tells you which algorithm to use. A business leader says “we need to understand our donors better” or “we’re worried about girls falling through the cracks” and it is your job as the data scientist to translate that into a concrete, solvable problem. As the textbook describes in the Career Pathways section, effective practitioners at the problem framing stage “determine which questions are worth answering, select success metrics, and translate context into requirements technical teams can implement.” The ability to look at a dataset and see opportunities, to ask “what questions could this data answer?”, is one of the most valuable skills you will develop. This project is designed to simulate that experience.
You are not being told what to predict, what to classify, or what to explain. The data has been carefully constructed with real, discoverable relationships across multiple domains. Your task is to find them. You will be evaluated relative to each other, and the teams that identify more meaningful opportunities and execute them well will earn higher scores.
How to Use AI Effectively
You are encouraged to use AI tools throughout this process, but how you use AI matters. We recommend using AI in the following sequence, which mirrors the pipeline stages you have learned:
1.        AI as Problem Setter (supports Problem Framing). Start by using AI to help you understand the business domain and brainstorm potential problems worth solving. Give AI the data dictionary and ask it to help you think about what questions the organization might need answered. Push it to consider both predictive questions (“Can we forecast which residents are ready for reintegration?”) and explanatory questions (“What factors most drive successful reintegration?”). Don’t accept its first suggestions uncritically. Push it to think deeper about the business context and to consider perspectives you might have missed.
2.        AI as Creative Expander (supports Data Preparation and Exploration). Once you have a candidate problem, use AI to help you think about features you might engineer, relationships you might explore, and data from other tables you might join. Ask it to suggest transformations, interaction terms, or aggregations you might not have considered. Remember that 60–80% of pipeline effort is data preparation. This is where AI can help you think more broadly about the raw materials available to you.
3.        AI as Critical Evaluator (supports Evaluation and the prediction/explanation tradeoff). Before you commit to a direction, use AI to poke holes in your approach. Ask it: “What could go wrong with this model? Am I confusing prediction with explanation?” Use it to stress-test your thinking the way a skeptical colleague would. For explanatory models, ask whether your causal claims are defensible. For predictive models, ask about data leakage and validation soundness.
4.        AI as Verification Agent (supports Evaluation and Selection). Use AI to verify that your code is correct, your evaluation methodology is sound, and your results make sense. Ask it to review your train/test split, validate your metrics, and confirm that your feature selection and hyperparameter tuning are reasonable.
5.        AI as Production Agent (supports Deployment). Finally, use AI to help you deploy your model, create API endpoints, build dashboard visualizations, and integrate your results into the web application. This is where AI can save you the most time on implementation details so you can focus on ensuring your deployed model provides real value to end users.
The key principle: you drive the thinking and decision-making at every stage. AI accelerates your work, but the intellectual ownership must be yours. You must understand and be able to explain every part of your pipeline. If you cannot explain why you made a particular choice, you are using AI incorrectly. The goal, as the textbook states, is “not just to fit models, but to build analytical capability that holds up in real environments.”
Applying the Principles from the Textbook
Your pipelines will be evaluated on how well they apply the principles taught in Chapters 1–17. Specifically, we will be looking for evidence that you understand:
•          Pipeline thinking over algorithm-only thinking (Foreword, Ch. 1): Each pipeline should tell a complete story from business problem to deployed solution, not just demonstrate that you can run an algorithm.
•          The prediction vs. explanation distinction (Foreword, Ch. 9–11): For each pipeline, you must explicitly state whether your goal is prediction or explanation and make modeling choices that are consistent with that goal. If you are explaining, coefficients and interpretability matter more than predictive accuracy. If you are predicting, out-of-sample performance matters more than whether individual coefficients are interpretable. Do not treat accurate predictions as causal evidence, and do not produce interpretable analyses that cannot be operationalized.
•          Rigorous data preparation (Ch. 2–3, 7): Feature engineering, handling missing data, building reproducible pipelines. The quality of what goes into the model matters as much as the model itself.
•          Thoughtful exploration (Ch. 6, 8): Demonstrate that you actually looked at the data before modeling. Distributions, correlations, anomalies, and relationships should be documented and should inform your modeling choices.
•          Appropriate model selection (Ch. 12–14): Use the right tool for the job. Consider multiple approaches. If you use an ensemble (Ch. 14), explain why it is appropriate. If you use a decision tree (Ch. 12), explain what you gain in interpretability.
•          Evaluation discipline (Ch. 15): Proper validation, appropriate metrics, honest interpretation of results. Understand the real-world consequences of errors for this specific organization.
•          Feature selection with purpose (Ch. 16): Don’t throw everything in and hope for the best. Demonstrate that you thought about which features matter and why.
•          Deployment as a first-class concern (Ch. 17): A model that only exists in a notebook is not a pipeline. Move it into production.
A team that demonstrates mastery of these principles across multiple pipelines will outscore a team that produces many pipelines with shallow execution. Quality and quantity both matter, but quality comes first.
Rubric (20 points total)
Your score will be based on the number of complete, quality pipelines your team delivers. Each pipeline will be evaluated using the following criteria aligned with the full ML pipeline:
Pipeline Stage
What We’re Evaluating
Problem Framing
Is the business problem clearly stated? Does it matter to the organization? Is the choice of predictive vs. explanatory approach explicitly justified?
Data Acquisition, Preparation & Exploration
Is the data explored thoroughly? Are missing values, outliers, and feature engineering handled well? Is the data preparation reproducible as a pipeline? Are joins across tables done correctly and documented?
Modeling & Feature Selection
Is the model appropriate for the stated goal (prediction or explanation)? Are multiple approaches considered or compared? Is feature selection thoughtful and justified?
Evaluation & Selection
Are appropriate metrics used? Is the model validated properly (e.g., train/test split, cross-validation)? Are results interpreted in business terms, not just statistical terms?
Deployment & Integration
Is the model deployed and accessible? Is it integrated with the web application in a meaningful way? Does it provide value to end users?

What to Submit
For each pipeline, submit a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) in your team’s GitHub repository inside a folder named ml-pipelines/. Name each notebook descriptively (e.g., donor-churn-classifier.ipynb, reintegration-readiness.ipynb). Each notebook should be self-contained and tell the complete story of that pipeline from problem framing through deployment. Specifically, each notebook must include the following sections:
1.        Problem Framing. A clear written explanation (not just code) of the business problem you are solving, who in the organization cares about it, and why it matters. Explicitly state whether your approach is predictive or explanatory and justify that choice using the framework from the textbook.
2.        Data Acquisition, Preparation & Exploration. Load the relevant data, explore it visually and statistically, document what you find (distributions, correlations, missing values, outliers), and prepare it for modeling. Show your feature engineering decisions and explain why you made them. If you join data from multiple tables, explain the logic. Build this as a reproducible pipeline (Ch. 7), not a one-off script.
3.        Modeling & Feature Selection. Build your model(s), compare approaches where appropriate, and document your choices. Justify your feature selection. If you try multiple algorithms, show the comparison. Include hyperparameter tuning if relevant. If your goal is explanatory, discuss what the model structure reveals about relationships in the data. If your goal is predictive, focus on out-of-sample performance.
4.        Evaluation & Interpretation. Evaluate your model using appropriate metrics. Use proper validation (train/test split, cross-validation). Interpret your results in business terms, not just reporting an R² or accuracy score; explain what it means for the organization’s decisions. Discuss the real-world consequences of false positives and false negatives for this specific context.
5.        Causal and Relationship Analysis. This is critical. For each pipeline, include a written analysis discussing the relationships you discovered in the data. What features are most important and why? Do the relationships make theoretical sense? If your model is explanatory, what causal story do the coefficients or feature importances tell? Are those causal claims defensible, or are you observing correlation? If your model is predictive, what does it reveal about the underlying data structure even if the goal isn’t causal inference? Be honest about the limitations: correlation is not causation, and you should discuss when you can and cannot make causal claims. This section is where you demonstrate that you understand the prediction vs. explanation distinction at a deep level.
6.        Deployment Notes. Briefly describe how this model is deployed and integrated into the web application (e.g., API endpoint, dashboard component, interactive form). Include any relevant code snippets or references to where the integration code lives in the repo.
The notebook should be fully executable. A TA should be able to run it top to bottom and reproduce your results. Make sure your data paths are correct relative to the repository structure.
In addition to the notebooks, your deployed web application should include the model outputs in a meaningful way (predictions, dashboards, interactive tools, etc.) as described in the Deployment & Integration section of the rubric.
Important Notes
•          Each pipeline must address a genuinely different business problem, not just the same problem with different algorithms.
•          A poorly executed pipeline will not help your score. Focus on doing each pipeline well before starting the next one.
•          Notebooks that are not executable or that lack written analysis will receive significant deductions regardless of model quality.
Final Deliverable Submission 
Deliverable Due Date: Friday April 10 at 10:00 am (the morning of the presentations). 
Deliverable Submission Location: https://byu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bsjPxSQyEdIQRhA  
Deliverable Content: 
Group Information - Please provide the correct group number and group members. 
URLs - Include the correct URLs to your Website, GitHub repository (linked to the correct branch), ipynb files for each pipeline (or a screenshot of your Azure ML Designer view), and video walkthroughs. Grading will go VERY badly if you make typos here. 
Please ensure when submitting that your GitHub repository is set to Public for grading purposes.  
Video Summaries - Each team should submit a link to the videos (one for each class) that go through the requirements of IS413, IS414, and IS455. Please be succinct in your coverage of each feature. Graders get grumpy and stop granting points when submitted videos ramble. Submit a link to the video hosted PUBLICLY (e.g., Box, Dropbox, YouTube, etc.). Your video must be accessible to TAs and Instructors. 
This video should provide ALL information that the graders need to evaluate your solution. The video should demonstrate that you have completed the requirements outlined in this document. If you have not completed something, be forthright about it in the video. Do not try to pass off unfinished requirements as complete. This is considered academic misconduct. You do not need to have all team members present or even show yourself in the video. Be thorough, but concise. 
Videos do not need to be professional, but they should clearly demonstrate the completion of requirements (at high enough resolution) and succinctly. If you record the wrong screen in your video and the graders cannot see the features, no points will be granted. Please check your videos before submitting.  
The videos must be available to all who have the link (i.e., public or unlisted, but not private) 
Each video should address the requirements for that class only. For example, the IS455 TAs will not be viewing the videos for IS413 and vice versa. 
If you do not demonstrate the completion of a requirement in your video, it will be considered missing. “We finished it but forgot to put it in the video …” or “...but we showed that feature in the video for another class…” will not be considered acceptable reasons to grant points for items not demonstrated in the videos. 
User Credentials - While you need to be very careful with credentials, please provide faculty and TAs the login credentials to your Web application. You will need to provide the usernames/passwords for the following: 
An admin user that does NOT have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled.  
A donor user that does NOT have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled but is connected with historical donations. 
An account (admin or donor) that DOES have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled. We won’t be able to get into this account, but we will use it to test whether MFA is required or not. 
 
The fastest way to upset your graders is making them do extra work to find the correct URLs or log in to your site. Points will be lost if we have to reach out for more information. Maximize your score by keeping your graders happy. 
 
Peer Evaluation 
 
You MUST complete the INTEX2 Peer Eval by Friday April 10th at 11:59 PM. The survey can be found here:

Please complete this immediately after your presentation. You will not receive an INTEX grade if you do not complete your peer evaluation. The results of your eval will be kept confidential, but it will affect team member grades. We want this to be fair for those that did the work. The solution is to make sure that you pull your weight and more. Help the team and be a great team member helping where needed and doing quality work! 
Presentation 
You will present your solution to a panel composed of industry professionals, faculty, and possibly TAs. Your solution will be evaluated on the quality of communication of the presentation, the effectiveness of your technology demo, your creativity in approaching the business problem, and how satisfied the clients are with your overall solution. The presentation will be worth 20% of the overall INTEX score. 
 
You will be randomly assigned a presentation slot. Presentations will be held Friday beginning at 12:00pm. A schedule with the assigned times for each group will be posted. Each presentation period will be structured as follows: 
 
Presentation and Tech Demo		20 minutes (Student group presents) 
Questions & Answers			5 minutes (Student group answers questions) 
Judge Deliberation 			5 minutes (Student group waits in the hall) 
Feedback 				5-10 minutes (Student group comes back to room) 
Break and Next Team Setup		5 minutes 
 
The judges for your presentation will take the role of the client. Your role is to pitch your system/solution as worthy of continued investment and/or adoption by the client. Get them excited about the system and how it meets their needs. The judging panel will be evaluating how your system works, how and whether it meets the client’s needs, the quality of the presentation, and whether you creatively went beyond the minimum requirements. The judges have technical expertise but will primarily evaluate the business case for investing in your solution. 
 
This is a business presentation with a substantive tech demo. The tech demo is likely the most important part of the presentation. Prioritize showing us your solution. The demo shouldn't be the only part of your presentation, but it is the most important part. It is probably useful to highlight the business problems and how you have solved them, but please don’t spend the majority of the presentation telling the client the case background. 
 
Do NOT bring handouts to the presentation.
